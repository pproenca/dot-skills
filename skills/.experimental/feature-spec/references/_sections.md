---

## 1. Scope Definition (scope)

**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Description:** Clear scope boundaries prevent scope creep, which causes over 40% of project failures. Defining what's in and out of scope upfront enables accurate estimation and stakeholder alignment.

## 2. Requirements Clarity (req)

**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Description:** Vague requirements cause costly rework and interpretation disputes. Specific, testable requirements enable accurate estimation and reduce development waste by 30-50%.

## 3. Prioritization (prio)

**Impact:** HIGH
**Description:** Proper prioritization ensures highest-value features ship first, maximizing ROI and reducing time-to-value for stakeholders.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria (accept)

**Impact:** HIGH
**Description:** Testable acceptance criteria define "done" unambiguously, preventing interpretation disputes and enabling QA to validate deliverables objectively.

## 5. Stakeholder Alignment (stake)

**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH
**Description:** Early and continuous stakeholder alignment prevents late-stage surprises, rejected deliverables, and costly direction changes.

## 6. Technical Specification (tech)

**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Description:** Clear technical specifications bridge business requirements to implementation, reducing developer ambiguity and architectural misalignment.

## 7. Change Management (change)

**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Description:** Controlled change processes preserve timeline and budget while allowing legitimate scope evolution through proper impact analysis.

## 8. Documentation Standards (doc)

**Impact:** LOW
**Description:** Consistent documentation standards improve long-term maintainability, onboarding, and knowledge transfer across teams.
