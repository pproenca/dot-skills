  "abstract": "Adversarial crash-hunting guide for iOS and Swift applications, designed for AI agents and LLMs. Contains 47 rules across 8 categories, prioritized by crash severity from critical (data races, memory corruption) to incremental (Objective-C interop traps). Every rule follows TDD: dangerous code, a failing test that proves the crash, and the fix that makes the test pass. Complements ios-testing, swift-optimise, and other ios-*/swift-* skills. Aligned with the iOS 26 / Swift 6.2 clinic modular MVVM-C architecture.",
