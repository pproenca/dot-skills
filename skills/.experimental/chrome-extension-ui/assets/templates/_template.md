## Rule Title Here

Brief explanation (1-3 sentences) of WHY this matters for Chrome extension UX/UI. Focus on user impact and development implications.

**Incorrect (description of what's wrong):**

```typescript
// Bad code example - production-realistic
// Comment explaining the cost or problem
```

**Correct (description of what's right):**

```typescript
// Good code example - minimal diff from incorrect
// Comment explaining the benefit
```

**When NOT to use this pattern:**
- Exception 1
- Exception 2
