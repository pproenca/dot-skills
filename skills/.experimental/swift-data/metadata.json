  "abstract": "Comprehensive data modeling, persistence, state management, sync architecture, and error handling guide for Swift and SwiftUI applications using SwiftData, designed for AI agents and LLMs. Contains 58 rules across 9 categories, prioritized by impact from critical (data modeling, persistence setup) to production architecture (sync, error recovery, state management). Each rule includes detailed explanations and real-world examples comparing incorrect vs. correct implementations to guide automated refactoring and code generation.",
