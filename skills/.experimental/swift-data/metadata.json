  "abstract": "Comprehensive data modeling, persistence, state management, sync architecture, and error handling guide for Swift and SwiftUI applications using SwiftData, aligned with modular MVVM-C repository architecture (see swift-ui-architect). Contains 60 rules across 9 categories, prioritized by impact from critical (data modeling, persistence setup) to production architecture (sync, error recovery, state management). SwiftData types (@Model, ModelContext, @Query) stay in Data-layer implementations behind Domain repository protocols. Views read Domain data from @Observable ViewModels; business logic lives in domain value types and repository-backed flows. Aligned with the iOS 26 / Swift 6.2 clinic modular MVVM-C architecture.",
