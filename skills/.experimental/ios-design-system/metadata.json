Each rule includes detailed explanations, production-realistic SwiftUI examples comparing incorrect vs. correct implementations, and specific impact metrics. Covers token hierarchy design, asset catalog organization, component style libraries (ButtonStyle, LabelStyle), spacing/sizing tokens, theming infrastructure, and automated governance.",
