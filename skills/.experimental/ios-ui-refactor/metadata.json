  "abstract": "Principal-level iOS UI review and refactoring guide for SwiftUI, grounded in three foundational design texts: Dieter Rams' Ten Principles for Good Design (less but better, honest, thorough), Ken Segall's Insanely Simple (remove complexity, speak human), and John Edson's Design Like Apple (systems thinking, the product is the marketing, prototype to perfection). Contains 51 rules across 8 principle-based categories: Less But Better (CRITICAL), Self-Evident Design (CRITICAL), Honest Interfaces (CRITICAL), Invisible Design (HIGH), Systems Not Pieces (HIGH), Thorough to the Last Detail (HIGH), Enduring Over Trendy (MEDIUM-HIGH), and Refined Through Iteration (MEDIUM). Each rule identifies a specific anti-pattern, grounds the fix in a named principle, and provides the correct iOS 17+ SwiftUI implementation.",
