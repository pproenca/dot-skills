Contains 46 rules across 8 categories, prioritized by architectural impact from critical (rich domain models, CRUD controllers) to foundational (testing, code style). Each rule includes detailed explanations, production-realistic code examples comparing incorrect vs. correct implementations, and references to official 37signals sources. Designed for AI agents and LLMs to guide code generation and refactoring toward the 37signals way.",
