Contains 50 rules across 8 categories, prioritized by migration urgency from critical (configuration migration, deprecated utility replacement) to incremental (modern feature adoption). Every transformation preserves the existing visual output — this skill focuses purely on cleaner code, modern v4 syntax, and elimination of code smells. Each rule includes incorrect vs. correct examples showing exact class-level transformations.",
