The section ID (in parentheses) is the filename prefix used to group rules.

## 1. Visual Hierarchy (hier)

**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Description:** Wrong hierarchy makes everything compete for attention, creating noisy, chaotic interfaces. Size, weight, and color are the three levers that direct the eye — misusing them is the #1 cause of amateur-looking UI.

## 2. Layout & Spacing (space)

**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Description:** Cramped layouts with inconsistent spacing are the most visible amateur tell. Generous, systematic whitespace creates clarity, groups related elements, and makes interfaces feel professional.

## 3. Typography (type)

**Impact:** HIGH
**Description:** Poor font choices, wrong line heights, and excessive line lengths destroy readability across every screen. Typography affects every piece of text in the interface.

## 4. Color Systems (color)

**Impact:** HIGH
**Description:** Ad-hoc color choices create inconsistent, inaccessible interfaces. A systematic palette with proper shade ranges and accessible contrast ratios builds user trust.

## 5. Depth & Shadows (depth)

**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Description:** Flat interfaces lack visual cues for elevation and interactivity. A consistent shadow scale creates dimension and guides user attention to interactive elements.

## 6. Borders & Separation (sep)

**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Description:** Over-reliance on borders creates cluttered, busy interfaces. Replacing borders with spacing, shadows, and background color differences produces cleaner separation.

## 7. Images & Content (img)

**Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM
**Description:** Uncontrolled images, poor text overlays, and neglected empty states break layouts and reduce perceived quality.

## 8. Polish & Details (polish)

**Impact:** LOW
**Description:** Small finishing touches — accent borders, custom icons, subtle gradients — compound into a polished, professional feel.
