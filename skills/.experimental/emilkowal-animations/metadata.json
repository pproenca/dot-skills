  "abstract": "Comprehensive animation guide for web interfaces based on Emil Kowalski's teachings, open-source libraries (Sonner, Vaul), and his animations.dev course. Contains 43 rules across 7 categories, prioritized by impact from critical (easing selection, timing) to polish (blur bridging, stagger orchestration). Each rule includes detailed explanations, production-realistic code examples comparing incorrect vs. correct implementations, and specific values to guide animation decisions.",
