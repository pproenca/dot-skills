## 1. Navigation (nav)

**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Description:** Tab bars, navigation stacks, split views, and toolbar placement define how users move through your app. Navigation is the most fundamental HIG topic — getting it wrong makes every screen harder to reach.

## 2. Interaction Design (inter)

**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Description:** Touch targets, gestures, haptics, keyboard handling, and swipe actions define how users physically interact with your app. Getting these wrong breaks the native iOS feel.

## 3. Accessibility (acc)

**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Description:** VoiceOver labels, Dynamic Type, color contrast, reduce motion, and focus management are not optional. Accessibility support is required for App Store quality and reaches 15%+ of users.

## 4. User Feedback (feed)

**Impact:** HIGH
**Description:** Loading states, error handling, notifications, success confirmation, and empty states communicate system status to users. Clear feedback builds trust and reduces confusion.

## 5. UX Patterns (ux)

**Impact:** HIGH
**Description:** Onboarding, permissions, modality, data entry, undo, confirmation dialogs, and settings organization follow Apple's established patterns that users already understand.

## 6. Visual Design (vis)

**Impact:** HIGH
**Description:** Dark mode support, SF Symbols usage, layout margins, and safe area handling ensure your app looks native and adapts to all system configurations.
