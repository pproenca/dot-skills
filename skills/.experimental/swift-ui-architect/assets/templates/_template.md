{1-3 sentences explaining WHY this matters. Focus on architectural or performance implications. Be definitive, not hedging.}

**Incorrect ({what's wrong}):**

```swift
{Bad code example - production-realistic, not strawman}
{// Comments explaining the cost/violation}
```

**Correct ({what's right}):**

```swift
{Good code example - minimal diff from incorrect}
{// Comments explaining the benefit}
```

**When NOT to use this pattern:**
- {Exception 1}
