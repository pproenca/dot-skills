  "abstract": "Principal-engineer-level refactoring guide for React applications. Contains 42 rules across 8 categories: State Architecture (prop drilling, state machines, derived state), Component Composition (compound components, slots, headless patterns), Abstraction Quality (Rule of Three, composition over configuration), Coupling & Cohesion (feature folders, dependency injection, interface segregation), Hook Hygiene (composition, naming, stability), Render Patterns (conditional rendering, keys, fragments), Side Effect Management (cleanup, event handlers), and Testability (seams, behavior testing, boundaries). Prioritized by impact from critical to incremental, with code smell indicators and safe transformation steps.",
