**Incorrect (description of the problem):**

```typescript
// Production-realistic code example showing the anti-pattern
// Include comments explaining the cost/issue
```

**Correct (description of the solution):**

```typescript
// Production-realistic code example showing the correct approach
// Use same variable names as incorrect example
// Include comments explaining the benefit
```
