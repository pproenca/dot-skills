  "abstract": "Comprehensive guide to building REST APIs that reach the Glory of REST (Richardson Maturity Level 3) in Ruby on Rails. Contains 47 rules across 9 categories, ordered by the request/response lifecycle — from resource URI design (nouns, plural, max 2 nesting levels) through HTTP method semantics (safe GET, idempotent PUT/DELETE, idempotency keys) and hypermedia controls (_links, affordances, entry points) to API evolution (additive changes, deprecation headers). Each rule includes Rails-specific code examples with incorrect vs. correct patterns.",
