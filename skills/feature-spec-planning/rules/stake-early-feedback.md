## Gather Stakeholder Feedback Early and Often

Don't wait until the end to show stakeholders the finished product. Share work-in-progress early to catch misalignment before significant investment. Late feedback is expensive feedback.

**Incorrect (big reveal at the end):**

```markdown
## Project Timeline

Week 1-2: Requirements gathering
Week 3-4: Design (internal only)
Week 5-8: Development (internal only)
Week 9: Stakeholder demo

// Stakeholder feedback at week 9:
// "This isn't what I expected at all"
// "Can we change the entire flow?"
// Result: 4 more weeks of rework
```

**Correct (continuous feedback loops):**

```markdown
## Project Timeline with Checkpoints

### Week 1: Problem Alignment
- [ ] Share problem statement with all stakeholders
- [ ] Confirm we're solving the right problem
- [ ] Document any disagreements

### Week 2: Requirements Review
- [ ] Share draft requirements document
- [ ] 48-hour feedback window
- [ ] Resolution meeting for conflicts
- **Checkpoint: Requirements approved**

### Week 3: Design Review
- [ ] Share wireframes and user flows
- [ ] Walkthrough with key stakeholders
- [ ] Incorporate feedback before high-fidelity
- **Checkpoint: Design direction approved**

### Week 4: Design Refinement
- [ ] Share high-fidelity mockups
- [ ] Prototype key interactions
- [ ] Final design sign-off
- **Checkpoint: Design approved for development**

### Week 6: Mid-Development Check
- [ ] Demo working prototype (even if incomplete)
- [ ] Validate core assumptions
- [ ] Surface integration concerns early
- **Checkpoint: No major direction changes**

### Week 8: Pre-Launch Review
- [ ] Feature complete demo
- [ ] Stakeholder acceptance testing
- [ ] Final go/no-go decision
- **Checkpoint: Launch approved**
```

**Feedback cadence by project size:**
- Small (< 2 weeks): Beginning and end
- Medium (2-6 weeks): Weekly checkpoints
- Large (> 6 weeks): Bi-weekly checkpoints + async updates
